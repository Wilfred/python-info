# Python Info Manuals

This is a simple Emacs package to provide an info manual for
Python. To run the makefile, you will need virtualenv and Python 2, then simply:

    $ cd build
    $ make

This will create `build/python.texi`.

## Licensing

This is really just a makefile, which is licensed under the BSD
license. The Python info files are under the
[PSF license](http://docs.python.org/2/license.html).
